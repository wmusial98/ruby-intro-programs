# Ruby Intro Programs
This is a repo of programs students are asked to create in the middle of the Ruby Lesson as part of The Odin Project Full Stack Ruby on Rails program found here:
https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails?

Rather than have a separate repo for each, I have put all of them in separate files for ease of access.
